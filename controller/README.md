# Controller
This README is to explain how to put together the physical components of the controller. While in development I will be using breadboards and converting them into a soldered pera-board once I feel comfortable with the layout. 

### Upgrade NodeJS on Pi
1. `sudo apt-get update`
2. `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`
3. `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -`
4. `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`
5. `node -v` to verify you have the correct version
6. If you get `/usr/local/bin/node` not found:
  - `ln -s /usr/bin/node /user/local/bin/node`

![DS18B20 Wiring Schematic](schematics/DS18B20_Schematic.png "DS18B20 Wiring Schematic")  
### Setup
1. Enable 1-Wire Mode. 
    1. Via Raspberry-Pi Configuration: 
        - Go to Raspberry-Pi Configuration -> Interfaces -> and Enable **1-Wire**
    2. Manually: 
        - `sudo apt-get update`
        - `sudo apt-get upgrade`
        - `sudo nano /boot/config.txt`
        - Add `dtoverlay=w1-gpio` on the bottom line
        - `CTRL-X` then `Y` then `RETURN`
        - `sudo reboot`
2. Find your 1-Wire Device running `ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/` in shell	
3. Copy /controller/rasperry-pi/piMonitor to your rasberry-pi
4. Setup a cron task to automatically run at the time interval you want
    * \*/15 \* \* \* \* python /var/www/piMonitor.py (this runs every 15 minutes)

## Atlas Scientific Conductivity Sensor
### Parts List
 * [Tentacle T3 for Raspberry Pi](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/components/tentacle-t3.html)
 * [EZO E.C. Circuit](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/circuits/ezo_ec.html)
 * [E.C. K 1.0 Probe](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/probes/ec_k1-0.html)
### Setup
 1. #### Change EZO Circuit from UART to I2C
     This procedure toggles the protocol between UART and I2C. If the EZO Circuit is in UART mode, this procedure will switch it to I2C. If it is in I2C mode, it will switch it to UART.
       - If Circuit is blinking `Green` and `Cyan` then the circuit is configured in UART mode
       - If Circuit is blinking `Blue` and `Cyan` then the circuit is configured in I2C mode  
     _Before starting the procedure, remove the EZO Circuit from the Tentacle (or other carrier boards). Remove power and all connections._

    This procedure is easiest using a breadboard and a set of jumper wires

      1. Connect (shortcut) these two pins:
        * PGND pin to the TX pin
      2. Power the EZO Circuit (GND, +5V)
      3. Wait for LED to change from green to blue (UART->I2C) or from blue to green (I2C->UART). 
      4. Remove the jumper wire from the PGND (or PRB respectively) pin to the TX pin
      5. Remove power (GND, 5V)  
2. #### [Calibrate your sensor](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/_files/_datasheets/_circuit/EC_EZO_Datasheet.pdf)
3. #### [Setup your PI](https://www.whiteboxes.ch/docs/tentacle/t3/#/quickstart)
    1. Do not plugin your Tentacle T3 to the PI yet, boot the PI
    2. `sudo raspi-config`
    3. Enable `I2C`
    4. Reboot your PI
    5. Upgrade PI with `sudo apt-get update` & `sudo apt-get upgrade`
    6. Install I2C Tools with `sudo apt-get install python-smbus` & `sudo apt-get install i2c-tools`
    7. Reboot the PI
    8. Test I2C `sudo i2cdetect -y 1`
    9. You should see `64` in the table

     * Be sure to cut the black and white wire as close to the board as possible
 4. Remove the black & white wire connections between each outlet (Save these pieces of wire)
     * Leave all the green (ground) connections as is since they are nicely soldered already
 5. Unscrew the front of the outlets to allow you to move them around a little
 6. Use pliers to break the gold connection tab on the hot side. Leave the white side in tact
 7. Use a wire nut to connect the incoming white wire to a short piece of wire to reach the first outlet (white side)
